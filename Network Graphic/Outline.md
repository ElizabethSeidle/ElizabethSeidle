# Creating a Network Graphic Visualization 

This project created a network graphic to visualize a group of faculty's collaborations with each other. Data was collected from the faculty themselves (mentoring data), PubMed (publication data), and NIH & NSF APIs (funding data). 

Different colors of edges represent different types of collabortion between two faculty. The color of the node corresponds to the faculty's position title and tenure.
